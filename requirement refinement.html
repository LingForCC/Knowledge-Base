<h1>Requirement Refinement</h1>
<p> </p>
<h2>Phases</h2>
<p>A requirement goes through 3 phases before it is ready for implementation. The first phase is Idea. In this phase, the requirement can be very rough. It just describes a customer's pain point or a very high level thinking of a feature which can resolve a specific customer's problem. Then the product team can take the idea and start to do product research and UI/UX design so the requirement can be brought to next phase, which is User Story. In this phase, the requirement is usually presented in UI mockup or interactive prototypes. The behavior is defined with description of user interaction. Once the requirement reaches this phase, the engineering team can be involved and start to bring the requirement to next phase, which is <a href="acceptance%20criteria.html">Acceptance Criteria</a>. During this period, the engineering team needs to understand the background of the requirement while considering from technical perspective to make sure the requirement is implementable. Engieering team and product team also need to work together to see if the scope of the requirement is complying with the Agile concept. Once the <a href="acceptance%20criteria.html">Acceptance Criteria</a> is done, the requirement is ready for implementation.</p>
<h2>Practice</h2>
<p>As shown in the diagram below, usually it takes around 1.5 sprints to bring User Story to <a href="acceptance%20criteria.html">Acceptance Criteria</a>. And it may require more time to convert an Idea into a User Story. Besides, this is a continuous process. In every sprint, the whole team needs to work on different requirements in different phases.</p>
