<h1>Monthly Review</h1>
<p>In order to connect with the employees and understand their latest thoughts, it is important to have a monthly review with your employee.</p>
<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>Usually the manager can go through a couple of questions as mentioned below to trigger the discussions. The manager should share these questions with the employees so employees can do some preparations before the review.</p>
<p><strong>Retrospective</strong><br />
What is the biggest accomplishment in last month?
Does it comply with company/team goal?
Does it comply with individual goal?</p>
<p><strong>Future</strong><br />
Is the company/team goal clear enough for next couple of months?
Does it help to improve myself and move forward in my career path?</p>
<p><em>If yes then</em></p>
<ul>
<li>What is the biggest challenge right now?</li>
<li>What things should we do differently?</li>
<li>What resources would be helpful?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If no</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Why is it?</li>
<li>What can we do to change it?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Open Discussion</strong><br />
Any relevant topic which is not mentioned before.</p>
<p>Notice that usually we can use the first two sections to trigger the discussion or find more things to discuss.</p>
<h2>After Review</h2>
<p>It is also important to take down notes during the review and do follow ups later.</p>
