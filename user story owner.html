<h1>User Story Owner</h1>
<p>User Story Owner is one of the <a href="roles%20in%20scrum.html">Roles in Scrum</a>. The responsibility for this role is to get an user story into <a href="definition%20of%20ready.html">DoR</a>. The reason we need this role is because the time to get an user story into <a href="definition%20of%20ready.html">DoR</a> is shorter than a release, managed by <a href="delivery%20captain.html">Delivery Captain</a>, and longer than a sprint, managed by <a href="sprint%20host.html">Sprint Host</a>(It usually takes 2-3 weeks to get an user story into <a href="definition%20of%20ready.html">DoR</a> status while <a href="delivery%20captain.html">Delivery Captain</a> is managing the things across 2-6 months and <a href="sprint%20host.html">Sprint Host</a> is managing the things in 1 sprint).</p>

<h2>Who</h2>
<p>User Story Owner is usually assigned by <a href="sprint%20host.html">Sprint Host</a> randomly.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Responsibility</h2>
<p>The responsiblity includes</p>
<p><strong>1. Understand the Timeline</strong><br />
The people acting on this role needs to understand when the user story needs to be implemented to get it to <a href="definition%20of%20ready.html">DoR</a> before hand.</p>
<p><strong>2. Write <a href="acceptance%20criteria.html">Acceptance Criteria</a></strong><br />
The people acting on this role needs to write down the <a href="acceptance%20criteria.html">Acceptance Criteria</a> and have it reviewed by Product Manager. The review process can be done with offline dicussion or a more formal Group Discussion meeting.</p>
<p><strong>3. Coordinate Technical Research</strong><br />
If an user story requires technical research to verify the feasibility, the people acting on this role needs to coordinate the research. It is not necessary that the research itself is done by the User Story Owner since people acting on this role may not have technical skills sometimes. But User Story Owner needs to be accountable for the research and make sure it is done on time.</p>
<p><strong>4. Coordinate UI Design</strong><br />
Similar concept applies to UI design. As the people acting on this role may not have UI design skills, the people acting on this role need to collaborate UI designers to move things forward.</p>
