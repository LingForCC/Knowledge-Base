<h1>Roles in Scrum</h1>
<p>One of the key concept of Agile is that an Agile team should be self-organized. And this is usually interpreted as an Agile team doesn't need clearly defined roles. But I think this is wrong. A self-organized team still needs clearly defined roles and responsibilities. But the difference, comparing to the old notion, is that those roles are defined and agreed by the team. And everyone in the team has got a chance to be one of those roles.</p>
<p>As most of the product is running under a combination of Agile and Waterfall manner, following 4 roles are required by a scrum team.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="delivery%20captain.html">Delivery Captain</a></li>
<li><a href="sprint%20host.html">Sprint Host</a></li>
<li><a href="user%20story%20owner.html">User Story Owner</a></li>
<li>Supervisor</li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, <a href="delivery%20captain.html">Delivery Captain</a> is acting like the tranditional project manager, who takes care the long term plan of a product. In the meantime, <a href="sprint%20host.html">Sprint Host</a> is focusing on current Sprint, mainly about conducting Sprint related activities. <a href="user%20story%20owner.html">User Story Owner</a> is responsible to make an Epic/User Story reach <a href="dor.html">DoR</a> state. At last, Supervisor is responsible for checking whether all the other 3 roles are handled correctly. If not, supervisor needs to provide guidance and suggestion accordingly.</p>
