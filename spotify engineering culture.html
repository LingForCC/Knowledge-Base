Leader’s job: communicate what needs to be solved and why

<p>Thought
We should make the learning cycle as a part of the team’s process and culture. The most difficult part is remember to track the progress. Basically, we can track the progress in planning meeting. And I can check progress in monthly review meeting as well.</p>
